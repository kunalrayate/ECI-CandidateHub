The application allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on candidate details, such as candidate ID, name, party name, assembly, state name, gender, and age.

## Features
1. **Select Query (View Data):**
   - View candidate details based on different filters such as state, party name, gender, etc.
   
2. **Insert Query (Add Data):**
   - Add new candidate information including candidate ID, name, party name, assembly constituency, state name, gender, and age.

3. **Update Query (Modify Data):**
   - Update existing candidate information by modifying attributes like name, party name, gender, age, etc.
   
4. **Delete Query (Remove Data):**
   - Delete candidate records from the system using the unique candidate ID.

## Attributes
Each candidate record consists of the following attributes:
- **c_id**: Candidate ID (Unique Identifier)
- **name**: Full name of the candidate
- **partyname**: Political party name
- **assembly**: Assembly constituency
- **statename**: Name of the state
- **gender**: Gender of the candidate
- **age**: Age of the candidate

## Technologies Used
- **MySQL**: Database to store candidate information.
